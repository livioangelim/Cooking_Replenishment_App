# Cooking Replenishment Project

## Overview

This Java project, developed by Livio Angelim Mororo, serves as the final project for the course Introduction to Java Programming at Sophia.com. The Cooking Replenishment project manages an inventory of ingredients and recipes, allowing users to add ingredients, create recipes, check for low ingredients, and simulate cooking processes. The project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

The project offers the following key functionalities:

- Ingredient Management: Add and track the quantity of ingredients in the inventory.
- Recipe Management: Create recipes and add them to the inventory.
- Low Ingredient Alert: Check and alert for low stock of ingredients.
- User Interaction: Console-based user interaction to manage the inventory and recipes.

## Enhancements
1. Database Integration

   Uses SQLite to store and manage ingredient and recipe data.
   Implements CRUD operations using SQL queries.

2. REST API

   Creates a RESTful API for managing inventory and recipes.
   Uses Spring Boot framework for setting up endpoints.

3. Unit Testing

   Implements unit tests using JUnit.
   Validates ingredient addition, recipe creation, and low stock alerts.

4. Error Handling

   Enhances error handling using exceptions and validation checks.

5. Concurrency

   Implements multithreading for handling large datasets and concurrent user interactions.

6. Documentation and Code Comments

   Provides detailed comments and generates documentation using Javadoc.

7. CI/CD Pipeline

   Sets up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

8. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

   Creates a simple GUI using JavaFX for managing the inventory and recipes.

9. Cloud Deployment

   Deploys the application on AWS using Docker.

10. Advanced Reporting

    Adds comprehensive reporting features and exports data to CSV and PDF formats.

## Usage

Upon running the program, it will manage the inventory and recipes by performing the following tasks:

- Add ingredients to the inventory
- Create and add new recipes
- Check and alert for low stock of ingredients
- Simulate cooking a selected recipe
